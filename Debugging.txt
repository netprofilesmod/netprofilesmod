This project is entirely developed with SharpDevelop: http://www.icsharpcode.net/opensource/sd/
To build the installer also the WiX Toolset is required: http://wix.codeplex.com/
(the latest tested versions are SharpDevelop 4.3 and WiX Toolset 3.7)

For successfully building and debugging Net Profiles mod please take care of the following:

1. Set Net Profiles mod as startup project in SharpDevelop.

2. Select the x86 platform. SharpDevelop only supports debugging of x86 code, the x64 platform is only used for
   building but not debugging. Building the AnyCPU release will fail, it is reserved for future use when MessageBoxHook
   is removed.

3. If Net Profiles mod is not installed, the service for applying IP settings via named pipe will be missing. In this
   case run the PipeServerTester without the debugger (will trigger an UAC dialog). Otherwise applying IP setttings
   will fail.

4. If Net Profiles mod is not installed, it will create a the folder structure in the ProgramData folder with different
   permissions for the profiles folder than the installer. This will allow users to create and edit (but not delete)
   profile files.
